### Demonstrations
Using location data to map which areas are likely to have most cases: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/milchada/COVID-Argentina/blob/master/notebooks/south-korea/heatmap.ipynb

Using location data to map who was in contact with who else: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/milchada/COVID-Argentina/blob/master/notebooks/south-korea/contact-graph.ipynb

A simulation that takes currently known information about who is tested positive, and probabilistically forward models which of the other people are expected to be infected, recover, or die as a function of time. https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/milchada/COVID-Argentina/blob/master/notebooks/simulation/hmm-sim.ipynb

### Model Specification

Let $N_c$ be the average number of interactions each person has in a day, $N_0$ be the population, $N_i$ be the number of infectious people. Then naively,

$$P(E(t+1) | S(t)) = \frac{N_c N_i}{N_0}.$$

Note: we will actually determine this based on contacts with infected people. So

$$P(E(t+1) | S(t)) = 1 - \prod_{\text{patient }i}(1 - P(\text{contact with patient }i) P(\text{patient }i\text{ infectious})).$$

The probability of transmitting the disease on contact is

$$P(I_A(t+1) \text{ or } I_P(t+1) | E(t)) = \frac{\beta_0}{N_c}$$

and otherwise, a person remains susceptible

$$P(S(t+1) | E(t)) = 1-\frac{\beta_0}{N_c}.$$

We treat appearance of symptoms and recovery as geometrically distributed with $p = \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda}$. So

$$P(I_P(t+1)|I_P(t)) = 1-\lambda_p$$
$$P(I_A(t+1)|I_A(t)) = 1-\lambda_a$$
$$P(I_M(t+1)|I_M(t)) = 1-\lambda_m$$
$$P(I_S(t+1)|I_S(t)) = 1-\lambda_s$$
$$P(H(t+1)|H(t)) = 1-\rho.$$

Finally, the remaining transition probabilities are defined as follows:

$$P(I_A(t+1) | I_A(t+1) \text{ or } I_P(t+1)) = \alpha$$

$$P(I_P(t+1) | I_A(t+1) \text{ or } I_P(t+1)) = 1 - \alpha$$

and

$$P(I_M(t+1) | I_P(t) \text{ and not } I_P(t+1)) = \mu$$

$$P(I_S(t+1) | I_P(t) \text{ and not } I_P(t+1)) = 1 - \mu$$

and

$$P(D(t+1) | H(t) \text{ and not } H(t+1)) = \delta$$

$$P(R(t+1) | H(t) \text{ and not } H(t+1)) = 1-\delta.$$
